# Math formulas
## Area
S is the Area; π (pi) is a constant (approx 3.14159); R is the Radius; a is the length (or height), and b is the width (or breadth).
- Circle: S = πR²
- Rectangle: S = ab
- Square: S = a²

## Perimeter
P is Perimetr; π (pi) is a constant (approx 3.14159); R is the Radius;  is the length (or height), and b is the width (or breadth).
- Circle: P = 2πR
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
- Square: P = 4a
